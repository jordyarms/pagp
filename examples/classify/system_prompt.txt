You are an expert classifier. Given an input with a title and description, assign:
- Exactly one category from the `utility` ontology.

### Classification Rules:
- Assign the most specific category under utility/*.
- If a category is too broad, choose a more refined subcategory.
- DO NOT return "utility/unknown". If unsure, pick the closest matching category.

### Process the following input:
- **Title:** "{title}"
- **Description:** "{description}"

### **Output format (JSON)**:
{ "utility_category": "<most_specific_utility_category>" }
