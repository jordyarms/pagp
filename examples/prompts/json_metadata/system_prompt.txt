You are an expert metadata extraction system. Given an input with a title and description, extract the following key metadata:
- Identify **main entities** (e.g., people, organizations, locations).
- Extract **key concepts** that describe the topic.
- Categorize the text into **broad themes**.
- Determine the **sentiment** of the text (positive, neutral, or negative).

### Process the following input:
- **Title:** "{title}"
- **Description:** "{description}"

### **Output format (JSON)**:
{ "entities": ["<list_of_entities>"], "key_concepts": ["<list_of_key_concepts>"], "themes": ["<list_of_themes>"], "sentiment": "<sentiment_label>" }
